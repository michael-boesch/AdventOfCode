# AdventOfCode

My solutions for AdventOfCode puzzles (adventofcode.com). No clean, polished and very well documented code.
Just made things run for finding the solution and went ahead. Do not excpect anything more.
As an "old" C programmer you'll also find many loops in case where Pyhton language would offer more elegant solutions, hehe.
