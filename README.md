# AdventOfCode

My solutions for AdventOfCode puzzles (adventofcode.com). No clean, polished and very well documented code.
Just made things run for finding the solution and went ahead. Do not expect anything more.
As an "old" C programmer you'll also find many loops in case where Python language would offer more elegant solutions, hehe.

As an additional goal with this years (2023) AdventOfCode is to get familiar with vi/Neovim editor.

Standard toolchain for AoC: python (with venv), spyder, sometimes jupyter-lab

Update, Dec 5th: Part 1 ok, Part 2 not yet; more difficult this year, needs to think more about proper algorithms.

Update, Dec 6th: Done in the evening; now easy again ... (compared to day 5)
